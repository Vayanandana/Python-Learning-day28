day 1 python learning and problems
Let's learn how to write a Python program to find the length of a string step by step.

Step 1: Understand the problem
We need to write a program that reads a word and prints the length of the word. The length of a string is the number of characters in the string.

Step 2: Get the word from the user
First, let's ask the user to enter a word. We'll use the input() function to get the value.
1.message = input()

Now we have the word as a string.

Step 3: Find the length of the word
We can find the length of the word using the len() function in Python.

2.length = len(message)

This will give us the length of the word as an integer.

Step 4: Print the result
Finally, we'll print the length of the word using the print() function.

print(length)
